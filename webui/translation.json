    "Intro": "is a framework for synthetic data generation guided by knowledge graphs, designed to tackle challenges for knowledge-intensive QA generation. \n\nBy uploading your text chunks (such as knowledge in agriculture, healthcare, or marine science) and filling in the LLM API key, you can generate the training data required by **[LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory)** and **[xtuner](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner)** online. We will automatically delete user information after completion.",
